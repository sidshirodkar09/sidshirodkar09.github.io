# Greetings! Here's how to support policy in Washington State.

## Why this mission is important:
Paid lobbyists are at the capitol every day influencing lawmakers to pass bills that hurt their constituents and help large corporations.
How can you stop it? We can influence lawmakers as well. Get into the game with written testimony or doing it online. Constituents fighting for their policy
makes a huge difference in a lawmaker's stance on a bill, and fighting to get good bills out of review committee is one of the best ways to spend your time
(even better than reposting stuff on instagram).

## How can you get started?
First, visit [The Washington Legislation Website.](https://leg.wa.gov) 
Then, scroll all the way down to the agenda - under "Floor and Meeting Calendars".


Choose an issue that's important to you or in current events and click "Agenda" to the right. 
Once you're there, choose a bill that's being heard to testify on. 
P.S: If you can't make it to Olympia, make sure the committee has virtual testimony support. 

Finally, click Testify. 
Under the second section, click I would like to testify during the hearing. If you can't, click I would like to submit written testimony. 
Now you have your unique zoom link- keep it safe. When the time comes, it is time to testify.

## But how do I testify?
First, I would recommend using ChatGPT to help you summarize and understand a bill, as they can be quite complicated.
You can also write your 1 minute speech with it, but a personal anecdote or story will always be more impactful to lawmakers than just information about the bill.
Take a second to write a quick story about something related to the bill- it doesnt need to take up the full 1 minute but it's better if it does. 

Good luck, and happy lobbying!
